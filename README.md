MPHPC

A modern PHP framework core.

This is my own take on what a modern PHP framework core should be.

Feature List:
* SASS Compilation
* JavaScript Compilation
* Global Site Settings
* Database Class
* Forms Class


ToDo:
* URL Rewrites
* Expand forms class to include more input methods
* Database sessions

This is still extremely unfinished.
