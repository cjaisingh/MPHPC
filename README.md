A modern PHP framework core.

This is my own take on what a modern PHP framework core should be.

Feature List
------------

-   SASS Compilation
-   JavaScript Compilation
-   Global Site Settings
-   Database Class
-   Forms Class

To Do
-----

-   Expand forms class to include more input methods
-   Standard for session variables according to page
-   Login System

This is still extremely unfinished.
